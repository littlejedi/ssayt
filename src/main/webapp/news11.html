          September 13, 2015<br>
          George E. DeBoer<br>
Deputy Director, AAAS Project 2061<br>
Professor Emeritus, Colgate University<br>
        </div>
<p>Project 2061 of the American Association for the Advancement of Science has a mission of science literacy for all. By science literacy we mean the knowledge and skills that all citizens need to function effectively in the world they live in. The knowledge and skills they acquire should be relevant to their everyday lives, personally satisfying, and it should enable them to pursue careers in both science and non-science fields. It should allow them to participate fully in society, as individuals and in their interactions with others, and with the social institutions that are the core of their communities.</p>

<p>As educators, we should be helping all students to develop their critical intelligence, their ability to make sense of the world they live in, and their willingness to challenge existing ideas, and their desire to innovate. This is challenging work. To be successful in this goal, science educators around the world should cooperate with each other in developing high standards for all students that acknowledge the global challenges facing us such as climate change, the need for sustainable environments, alternative forms of energy, efficient means of food production and distribution, and the health and well-being of all citizens. Science educators should also consider sharing their expertise and resources in order to develop the best curriculum and assessment materials possible. If we work together, we can do more than any one country can do alone.</p>

<p>When I spoke at the 2015 Shanghai International Forum on Science Literacy for Adolescents on September 13, I shared with my Chinese colleagues the continuing efforts to improve science education in the United States. I reviewed the history of science education standards in the United States, including how AAAS’s Science for All Americans set the stage for standards development by laying out a comprehensive vision of science literacy for all. I pointed out how Benchmarks for Science Literacy was the first national science education standards document in the United States, which then served as a model for both state and national standards that followed.  I also reported on the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS), the most recent effort to define what all students should know and be able to do in science. In my discussion of NGSS, I focused on three-dimensional learning, one of the key features of these new standards. Three dimensional learning is the idea that three dimensions of science—disciplinary core ideas, crosscutting concepts, and the practices of science and engineering—should be taught together in an integrated fashion. I also shared with the audience some of the current and recent efforts of AAAS in science education to provide tools and resources to assist assessment and curriculum developers and classroom teachers to achieve the goal of science literacy for all. I presented the AAAS assessment website (assessment.aaas.org), an online module for middle school students that helps them understand basic ideas about weather and climate using Google maps and NOAA weather data (WeatherSchool.aaas.org), and Toward High School Biology, a curriculum unit for middle school students to help them understand the molecular basis of living systems. In my talk, I focused on how these materials are addressing the NGSS call for three-dimensional learning.</p>

<p>In the afternoon I was part of a forum on integrated STEM learning. At that forum, a number of Chinese educators presented STEM courses that they had developed. I was then asked to comment on these courses and to share my ideas about integrated STEM. I responded positively to what had been presented and talked about the value of using integrated STEM courses to organize ideas from a variety of disciplines around one or more integrative themes. I pointed out how mathematics, technology, engineering design, and science concepts can all be used to help understand many currently important science and engineering problems, but I also noted the difficulties of creating courses like this when most science teachers, whether in China or the United States, have been trained to teach a single discipline. I also pointed out the value of a disciplinary approach to science teaching and how using a disciplinary approach focuses attention and enables teachers, curriculum developers, and ultimately students to concentrate on a subset of the entire science domain in a coherent way. I emphasized that such a disciplinary approach should acknowledge connections to other disciplines whenever possible. Both disciplinary science courses and integrated STEM courses, with their more thematic approach, have value in a school science curriculum.</p>
<p>In all of what I heard from my Chinese colleagues who gave talks in the morning session and the presenters in the afternoon forum, I was encouraged that the goals for science education in China and the U.S. are very similar. It should be very easy and productive for us to work together toward common ends. In both countries here is a strong emphasis on the usefulness of science knowledge both for personal and societal benefit. Together we recognize the importance of developing students’ critical intelligence, their skills of inquiry, and their desire to innovate and challenge what they hear. There will of course also be differences in our approaches, but I believe they are small compared to the much greater degree of overlap in the desires we both have to create learning environments in which all students can reach their full potential and become productive citizens in their respective countries and the world.</p>
